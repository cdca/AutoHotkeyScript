# AutoHotkeyScript

This script helps to select(mark) process IDs and switch between them.  
This script also helps to manipulate with current track that is playing (globally).   

# Usage:
Use keys F9-F12 to mark process ID.  
Use keys F1-F4 to switch between marked process.  
(F9 marks proccess that will be activeted with F1, F10 - F2, F11 - F3, F12 - F4 ) Or use your own keys.  

Use ~ key to minimize current window. (I find this key super neat and very useful)  


Numpad+ = Play/Pause track  
Numpad- = Play next track  
Numpad* = Play previous track     

Using media keys may activate Windows media control overlay popup. You can turn off this in application settings.   
Spotify - you can change this at "Show desktop overlay when using media keys".  
Chrome  - go under chrome://flags/ then Media Session then disable Hardware Media Key Handling.   


My setup when working is like this:  
F1 - Chrome  
F2 - IDE  
F3 - Chrome (2nd user)  
F4 - Spotify  

After i've marked IDs it is very productive to switch fast between them especially when having multiple Chrome users. You can even mark different IDs to same Chrome user if you are using several Chrome windows.   


This is my first script so i am not sure if usage is clear enough. 
Good luck using it!
